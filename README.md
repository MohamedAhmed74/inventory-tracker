# Steps

- Press the green **"Run"** button (on the repl)
  - This should open a testing mini-browswer (next to the editor).
  - Click the **"Open in new tab"** button on the **right-hand side** of the address bar (for the mini-browser)
  - In the new tab append "/docs" to url
    - Example: if the new tab contains `longname.repl.co` --> `longname.repl.co/docs`
- Voila. Use the docs to test the API endpoints.
  - Each tag (i.e. `inventory` and `warehouse`) represent different resources; each of those resources have 4 (or more) endpoints that support CRUD operations.
